## General info
This web app allows the user to join the social platform. Each user will be able to make changes to their account and to communicate with other users. The user will be able to tag any photo on the internet and share it with other users, as well as see the activity of the users they follow and like (or dislike) the photos they share.

## Technologies
* Python 3.12.0
* Django 5.0.3
  
## Setup
Please make sure you have Python already installed on your machine.
Then, clone this repo to your desktop, activate virtual env and install all dependencies thru pip with a command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Once the dependencies are installed, run `py manage.py runserver` to start the web app on your localhost.

## Status
App is completed and ready to use, however I plan to expand app functionalities (see next paragraph).

## To Do
* Creating a ranking of images based on the number of likes received;
* Adding a field showing the number of views of each image.

## Sources
This app is created based on Antonio Mel√© book "Django 3 By Example: Build powerful and reliable Python web applications from scratch, 3rd edition", based on the latest versions of the technlogies used.
